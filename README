Term-Emit-Format-HTML version 0.0.2

SYNOPSIS

    use Term::Emit::Format::HTML 'format_html';
    my $out = "some output from Term::Emit";
    my $html = format_html($out);


DESCRIPTION

This module reformats the output from an application that uses
Term::Emit into a chunk of HTML, which you can embed in a web page.

This module is handy if you write Web UIs that wrap a command line
utility and show the output from that utility on a web page.

Suppose you have a utility that produces this output:

    Quobalating all frizzles...
        We operate on only the first and
        second frizzles in this step.
      Merfubbing primary frizzle.......... [OK]
      Xylokineting secondary frizzle...... [WARN]
    Quobalating all frizzles.............. [DONE]

This module can parse that output and convert it into this:

    <h1 class="done">Quobalating all frizzles</h1>
      <p>We operate on only the first and second frizzles in this step.</p>
      <h2 class="ok">Merfubbing primary frizzle</h2>
      <h2 class="warn">Xylokineting secondary frizzle</h2>

Note how the steps that have completed with a status, such as [OK] or [DONE],
get tagged in the resulting HTML with a class.  This simple hook allows you
to do some fancy CSS so you can associate images, colors, and so forth
with the output to really spiff up your web page.
